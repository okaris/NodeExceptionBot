# NodeExceptionBot

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/node-exception-bot.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/node-exception-bot/)

A Telegram Bot that keeps you updated about the uncaught exceptions from your node server.

# Setup

To get your NodeExceptionBot API Key, go to Telegram and chat with **@NodeExceptionBot**

This module takes in two variables. The first is your **NodeExceptionBot API Key** and the second is a **prefix**. Prefix is optional. You can use the prefix to distinguish between multiple servers.

# Usage

Just importing the module with correct variables is sufficient.

`var exception = require('node-exception-bot')("API-KEY","MessagePrefix(optional)");`
